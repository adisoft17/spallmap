#
# This listing of TELLURIDE compile flags is included in the GNUmakefile
# ONLY if the executable is to run under WindowsNT.  The compile flags include
# those for the C pre-processor, the Fortran 90 compiler, and the C
# compiler.  
#
# These flags are currently all wrong, unless we get DECs compiler for WNT!
#
# Certain aspects of the format of this file must be rigidly followed
# so that the GUI can parse it correctly.  These are detailed below.
#
# o Lines that should be passed straight to the makefile.  Examples are
#   the suffix used by the compiler for list and module information files,
#   paths to module information files, etc.
#
#  - A single comment line of the form:
#
#    # Verbatim: Comment
#
#    The comment string is not used by the GUI and can be anything.
#
#  - A single blank line.
#
#  - Any number of lines, followed by a blank line.  These lines are
#    read by the GUI and passed straight to the makefile fragment included
#    by GNUmakefile.
#
# o Compile flags that are toggled must be defined as follows:
#
#  - A single comment line of the form:
#
#    # Flag: Description
#
#    "Description" is a brief description of what the flag controls,
#    for example "Enable profiling with prof" (omit the quotes).
#    This string is displayed in a popup in the GUI when setting compile
#    flags.
#
#  - A single blank line.
#
#  - A line of the form:
#
#    FFLAGS += -flag1 -flag2
#
#    If the flag is to be off by default, add a comment character (#)
#    immediately in front of the word FFLAGS (NO space must appear 
#    between # and FFLAGS).
#
#    Some flags for some compilers are of the form "-flag value".  This
#    is fine.
#
# o Some compile flags, such as optimization level, may have several
#   allowable values.  These are placed into a menu in the GUI and must
#   be defined slightly differently in this file:
#
#  - A single comment line of the form:
#
#    # Menu: Description
#
#    Again "Description" is a brief description of what the flags in
#    this menu will control, for example "Debugging/Optimization".
#    However, in this case only the first word will be used by the GUI.
#    It becomes the menu name.  So for example you could not have used
#    "Debugging / Optimization" in this example, as only "Debugging"
#    would have been used.
#
#  - A single blank line.
#
#  - A series of lines of the form:
#
#    FFLAGS += -flag
#
#    one for each appropriate value.  There must be no blank lines
#    between the lines, and the final value must be followed by a
#    blank line.  Since the values are assumed to be mutually-exclusive,
#    at most one of the lines of values must be uncommented.  The
#    remainder must be commented-out as described above.
